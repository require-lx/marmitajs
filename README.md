A platform connecting food makers, distributers and consumers should not be controlled by anyone.

## What ?

It's a platform and cli that comes with the tools for everyone to get any marmita delivered anywhere!

## TODO

1. Write a [client](https://github.com/darkbls/marmita) and a platform to make it really marmita
agnostic and not limited to "A Marmita".
